## To do
1. Backend
 - [x] Backend maintains game-state between users

 - [x] User logins
 - [x] Backend enforces user turns
 - [x] Backend enforces game rules
 - [x] Tiles are lost if they're not connected to a magic tile
 - [ ] Highlight valid moves for user, once they've selected a tile

2. Frontend
 - [x] Generate game board
 - [ ] Only current player has tiles highlighted, not both players
 - [ ] Skin game board so it's not ugly
